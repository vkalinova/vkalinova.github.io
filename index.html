							<p><strong>Quenching stages and nuclear activity of nearby galaxies </strong></p>
							<p>
								<img src="images/QuestNA_website.png" alt="QuestNA" class="center" style="width:80%;"/></p>
							<p>
								  In my recent paper (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...648A..64K/abstract">Kalinova et al., 2021, A&A, 648, A64</a>),
						                  we develope a 2D emission-line classification "QuestNA" taking into account both star formation quenching stages of the galaxies and their nuclear activity. 
								The rows of QuestNA classification represents the quenching stages (star-forming, quiescent-nuclear-ring, centrally quiescent,
								mixed, nearly retired, and fully retired), which represent different snapshots of galaxy evolution.  
								The ‘retired/star-forming regions’ ratio of the galaxy incresases from star-forming to fully retired galaxies (from the top to bottom). 
								The columns of the proposed classification reflect the level of galaxy nuclear activity per quenching stage: non-active, weak, and strong AGN (from left to right).
								It is interesting to further explore whether QuestNA classification can be considerred as an evolutionary diagram 
								from star-forming to retired classes or at least whether there is an geneological connection between the different stages.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Circular velocity curve classification from Principal Component Analysis</strong></p>
							<p>
								<img src="images/Prototype_mean.png" alt="" style="width:600px;height:300px;"/> </p>
							<p>
								The total circular velocity curve (CVC) of galaxies includes the gravitational potential of stars, gas, and dark matter. 
								Therefore, CVC is one of the main tools for studying galaxy structure and tracing the fossil records of the galaxies of their past.
								In addition, in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.469.2539K/abstract">Kalinova et al. 2017b</a>, we 
								find that the CVCs of the galaxies  trace the evolutionary stages of these systems. 
								Galaxies that have slowly increasing CVCs are characteristic for young, low-mass, low-metal, high-dark-matter-content galaxies. 
								While those with steep (sharp-peaked) curves are typical for old, high-mass, high-metal and relatively less-dark-matter-content galaxies.
								Flat and Round-peaked classes appear presented by galaxies with intermediate mass, age, luminosity, metallicity, bulge-to-disc ratio,  
								morphologies and dark mater fractions.
								We analyse the  CVCs from the de-projected surface brightness of the galaxies, after scaling by a 
								constant mass-to-light ratio based on stellar dynamics (solving axisymmetric Jeans equations via 
								fitting the second velocity moment of the stellar kinematics) from 
								<a href="http://califaserv.caha.es/CALIFA_WEB/public_html/?q=node/1">CALIFA survey</a> using 238 galaxies. 
								We further apply Principal component analysis (PCA) to the CVC shapes and amplitudes to find 
								characteristic features and use a k-means classifier to separate the circular curves into described above classes.
							</p>	
								<p><strong>Inner mass distribution of late-type spiral galaxies</strong></p>
							<p><img src="images/Inner_mass_distribution.png" alt="" style="width:600px;height:300px;"/> </p>
							
							In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.464.1903K/abstract">Kalinova et al., 2017a</a>,
							we examine the central mass distributions of 18 late-type spiral galaxies using 
							two different dynamical modelling approaches - the asymmetric drift correction (ADC) that adopts a thin disc approximation
							and axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian expansion (JAM) model that does a full 
							line-of-sight velocity integration. We use stellar kinematics maps obtained with the integral-field spectrograph 
							<a href="https://www.ing.iac.es/PR/SH/SH2007/sauron.html">SAURON</a> 
							to derive the corresponding circular velocity curves from the two models. 
							To find their best-fitting values, we apply the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. 
							ADC and JAM modelling approaches are consistent within 5 per cent uncertainty when the ordered 
							motions are significant comparable to the random motions, otherwise if their ratio is lower than 1.5 times, 
							ADC underestimates the calculated mass of the galaxies and invalidates the thin disc assumption.
							Since the stellar masses of the galaxies in our sample are not confined to their disc planes,  
							it is likely that they have a non-negligible contribution from their bulges and thick discs.
